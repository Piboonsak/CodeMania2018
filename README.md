# CodeMania2018: Make seamless development on cloud with kubernete

Reference tool from "devspace" :https://github.com/covexo/devspace/blob/master/README.md

Program inside any Kubernetes cluster (e.g. minikube, self-hosted or cloud platform) and:

iterate quickly: no more building and pushing images on every change, use hot reloading instead (e.g. with nodemon)
keep your existing workflow and tools: the DevSpace CLI works with every IDE (no plugins required)
access cluster-internal services and data during development
debug efficiently with port forwarding and terminal proxying
migrate to Docker & Kubernetes within minutes
